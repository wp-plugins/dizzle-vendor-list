Usage

You can display your vendor list in any Page or Post by including a Wordpress short code in your post body.  To display your entire vendor list, specify your profile slug (ususally your email address) in the list attribute of the dizzle_vendor shortcode.  For example:

[dizzle_vendor list="will@dizzle.com"]

This will output your vendor list to the page, including 2 forms of navigation.  To disable navigation, you can specify on or more attributes:

[dizzle_vendor list="sandiego" dropdown_nav="false" link_nav="false"]

To limt the list to a particular category, include the category attribute:

[dizzle_vendor list="sandiego" category="Home Inspection"]

To limt the list to a single vendor, include that vendor's id:

[dizzle_vendor list="sandiego" vendor="w2GtMjxBsh"]

[dizzle_vendor list="sandiego" dropdown_nav="false" link_nav="false"]
